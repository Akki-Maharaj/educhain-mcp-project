MCQs on Python loops:

{"questions":[{"question":"What is the output of the following code: \n\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(i)\n\n?","answer":"0\n1\n2","explanation":"The range function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, the specified stop value. In this case, it generates 0, 1, and 2.","options":["0\n1\n2","1\n2\n3","0\n1\n2\n3","2\n1\n0"]},{"question":"Which of the following correctly creates a while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5?","answer":"i = 1\nwhile i <= 5:\n    print(i)\n    i += 1","explanation":"This code initializes i to 1 and continues looping until i is greater than 5, printing the value of i and incrementing it by 1 in each iteration.","options":["while i < 5:\n    print(i)\n    i += 1","i = 1\nwhile i <= 5:\n    print(i)\n    i += 1","for i in range(5):\n    print(i)","do:\n    print(i)\nwhile i < 5"]},{"question":"What will be the result of this code?\n\nfor i in range(1, 10, 2):\n    print(i)\n","answer":"1\n3\n5\n7\n9","explanation":"The range function here starts at 1 and goes up to, but does not include, 10, incrementing by 2 each time. Therefore, it will print the odd numbers from 1 to 9.","options":["1\n3\n5\n7\n9","1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9","2\n4\n6\n8","0\n2\n4\n6\n8"]}]}
