## Features

- **Secure Credential Storage:** Educational credentials are securely stored on a blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof and transparent records.
- **Instant Verification:** Certificates can be verified instantly without intermediaries, simplifying trust validation.
- **Decentralized Data Management:** Uses decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS) to ensure availability and prevent data loss.
- **User Roles & Permissions:** Supports different user roles such as students, institutions, and employers with permissioned access.
- **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Utilizes AI models like Claude AI to generate educational materials, such as multiple-choice questions and lesson plans.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use frontend built with React.js for seamless interaction by users.
- **Blockchain-Backed Certification:** Issues and verifies certificates using the EduChain blockchain framework.

## Technologies Used

### Backend & Server

- **FastMCP**: A framework for building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, facilitating communication between AI models and external systems.
- **Python 3.11**: The programming language used for backend development.
- **Claude Desktop**: An AI model integrated into the system for generating educational content.

### AI & Content Generation

- **Claude AI**: Utilized for generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and lesson plans.
- **OpenRouter**: A platform for routing requests to AI models, used here to interface with Claude.
- **DeepSeek**: An AI model accessed via OpenRouter for educational content generation.

### Frontend

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the frontend development of the platform.

### Blockchain & Certification

- **EduChain**: The blockchain framework employed for issuing and verifying educational credentials.
- **IPFS**: Used for decentralized storage of educational content and certificates.

### Configuration & Integration

- **JSON**: Configuration files (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json`) used for setting up and integrating various components.
